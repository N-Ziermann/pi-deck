# pi-deck
A stream deck alternative based on electron and react.

## Installation
Choose one of the builds from the release section that best fits your system and install it on the device you want to control.

You will also need to have python as well as the pynput module installed.

It is highly advised to add the pideck software to your autostart programms to allow your macros to work right when the computer starts.

## Configuration
When you open the pideck desktop app you will see an icon appear in your Tray/Taskbar.

Clicking it will allow you to open the configuration interface in which you can add macros to each of the buttons the pideck provides.

## Using the pideck
When you're done configuring your pideck you can use your phone to head to the url displayed on the bottom right of the configuration panel.

Here you'll be able to execute the configured commands by pressing the any of your assigned buttons.
